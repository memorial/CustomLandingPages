                <p class="justify">The first diagnosis of cancer, the stage of the cancer and the treatment protocol of
                    the cancer can be determined with PET/CT. It is an imaging test that helps reveal how your tissues
                    and organs are functioning by using radioactive drug (tracer) to show cancers activity. A PET/CT
                    scan can provide a vision to fight effectively against cancer.</p>
                <p class="justify">Positron Emission Tomography–Computed Tomography (better known as PET/CT) is a
                    medical imaging technique using a device which combines in a single gantry system both a positron
                    emission tomography (PET) scanner and an x-ray computed tomography (CT) scanner. Combining a PET
                    scan with an MRI or CT scan can help make the images easier to interpret.</p>
                <h4 class="color-memorial text-bold mb-20 mt-40">Common Uses of the Procedure</h4>
                <p>PET and PET/CT scans are performed to:</p>
                <li class="justify">Detect cancer.</li>
                <li class="justify">Determine whether a cancer has spread in the body.</li>
                <li class="justify">Assess the effectiveness of a treatment plan, such as cancer therapy.</li>
                <li class="justify">Determine if a cancer has returned after treatment.</li>
                <li class="justify">Determine blood flow to the heart muscle.</li>
                <li class="justify">Determine the effects of a heart attack, or myocardial infarction, on different
                    areas of the heart.</li>
                <li class="justify">Identify areas of the heart muscle that would benefit from a procedure such as
                    angioplasty or coronary artery bypass surgery (in combination with a myocardial perfusion scan).
                </li>
                <li class="justify">Evaluate brain abnormalities, such as tumors, memory disorders, seizures and other
                    central nervous system disorders.</li>
                <li class="justify">Map normal human brain and heart function.</li>
                <h4 class="color-memorial text-bold mb-20 mt-40">How You Should Prepare for a PET and PET/CT Scan</h4>
                <p class="justify">For a PET/CT scan, at least 6 hours of starvation process is required since eating
                    may alter the distribution of the PET tracer in your body and can lead to a suboptimal scan. This
                    could require the scan to be repeated on another day, so following instructions regarding eating is
                    very important. You should not drink any liquids containing sugars or calories for several hours
                    before the scan. Instead, you are encouraged to drink water. If you are diabetic, you may be given
                    special instructions.</p>
                <p class="justify">Women should always inform their physician or technologist who are performing the
                    exam if there is any possibility that they are pregnant or if they are breastfeeding. The physician
                    and technologist should always be informed about any medications, vitamins and herbal supplements
                    you are taking. They also have to be informed about allergies and recent illnesses or other medical
                    conditions.</p>
                <p class="justify">You will receive specific instructions based on the type of PET scan you are
                    undergoing.</p>
                <p class="justify">Metal objects including jewelry, eyeglasses, dentures and hairpins may affect the CT
                    images and should be left at home or removed prior to your exam.</p>
                <h4 class="color-memorial text-bold mb-20 mt-40">How the Procedure Will Be Performed</h4>
                <p class="justify">First of all patients’ blood sugar will be measured. When the blood glucose is at the
                    desired level, radioactive material will be injected intravenously depending on the type of nuclear
                    medicine exam you are undergoing. There are several radioactive substances, but the most common used
                    is the F-18 Fluorodeoxyglucose. This material, called Fluoro-18 is a sugar based molecule which is
                    bound to the radioactive substances. There are also many other radiopharmaceuticals which are used
                    routinely.</p>
                <p class="justify">Following the injection, the patient is kept for approximately an hour to disperse
                    the radiotracer through the body and to be absorbed by the organ or tissue being studied. During
                    this procedure you will be asked to rest quietly, avoiding movement and talking. Then, the PET-CT
                    scans will be taken. Total scanning time is approximately 30 minutes.</p>

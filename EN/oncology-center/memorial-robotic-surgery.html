                <p class="justify">Da Vinci Robotic Surgery or also known as robotics, is the most advanced technology
                    in the medical world and is especially used in Turkey, especially in major centers in the US,
                    including the departments of urology, gynecology, general surgery, otorhinolaryngology, thoracic
                    surgery and cardiovascular surgery. The “da Vinci Robot Technology” stands out as a technology with
                    special privileges it provides to the physician and the patient and is today one of the most
                    successful surgical methods used in the fight against cancer all over the world. The robot assisted
                    laparoscopic surgery method, shortly known as “robotic surgery” has three main characteristics. The
                    first of these are the imaging systems, which work with the principle of laparoscopic surgery. So
                    the image is transferred through the body of the patient to the surgeon with the help of a camera.
                    In contrast to laparoscopic surgery, in robotic surgery this image is three-dimensional and since
                    the camera control is performed by a robot, the image is steady. Clear images can be obtained at a
                    larger magnification by approaching the organ to be operated very closely. The surgeon controls the
                    robot arms using a console. These robot arms are placed in the patient. Fiber optic cables in the
                    console extend to the arms of the robot and transfer the small hand movements made by the surgeon to
                    the robotic arms. Surgical instruments connected to the robotic arms can rotate 540 degrees so that
                    they can move much more than hand movements. In addition, the natural shivering in the hands of a
                    human is not conveyed to the tips of the surgical devices in robotic surgery. In this way, the
                    margin of error is also minimized.</p>
                <h4 class="color-memorial text-bold mb-20 mt-40">Nerve Protection in Protstate Cancer Surgeries</h4>
                <p class="justify">Following prostate cancer surgery, which is the most common male cancer occurring
                    especially in men over 50 years of age and developed in countries other than skin cancer, sexual
                    dysfunction and urinary incontinence problems, which are the two most important risks negatively
                    affecting the social life of men, can be observed. These risks, which can negatively affect the
                    patient's quality of life, are minimized in prostate cancer surgeries performed via the “da Vinci
                    Robotic Surgery” technique. The erectile nerves and the urinary retention muscles adjacent to the
                    prostate and leading to the penis are much better protected via robot technology. Thanks to this
                    qualified protection, the risks of urinary incontinence and the risk of penile erectile dysfunction
                    are minimized. With the “Intrafacial Nerve Protection” technique applied via robot surgery, the risk
                    of experiencing sexual activity problem after a surgery is minimized.</p>

                <li class="justify">In the hospitalization period and after leaving the hospital, very little pain
                    relief is required. This is because the patients do not feel pain.</li>
                <li class="justify">In the first week after surgery (approximately 4 or 6 days later), a catheter is
                    placed into the urethra. In open surgery, this period usually ranges from 14 to 31 days.</li>
                <li class="justify">• Approximately 90% of patients return to their routine work with or after 3 weeks
                    of operation with da Vinci Robotic Surgery.</li>
                <h4 class="color-memorial text-bold mb-20 mt-40">Kidney Protective Effect in Kidney Tumor Operations
                </h4>
                <p class="justify">In kidney tumor surgeries performed via the da Vinci technique, cancer control is
                    provided in the best possible way. Only the tumor tissue is removed and the healthy kidney is left
                    in the patient. Under the three-dimensional and high-resolution enlarged image with robot
                    technology, the tumor is easily removed from the kidney by performing depth calculation in the
                    tissue. The area where the tumor emerges can be sutured quickly and with depth control. After the
                    removal of the tumor tissue, the resulting tissue cavity, opened veins and injured urinary channels
                    are repaired extensively and rapidly by using robotic arms. This method can be performed for the
                    removal of the kidney in large-scale kidney cancer.</p>

                <p class="justify">In developed countries; bladder cancer, which is ranking 4th in men and 7th in women,
                    is treated with da Vinci Robotic Surgery without creating a surgical incision on the body. In open
                    bladder cancer operations; at a point starting 4-5 cm above the belly, the bladder and lymph nodes
                    are removed with an incision extending to the pelvic bone, and the bladder made from the intestine
                    is also connected to the normal urinary tract. In addition, patients who have their bladder removed
                    may have problems such as carrying bags continuously in their bellies or using urethral catheter at
                    regular intervals. In bladder cancer operations performed with da Vinci Robotic Surgery, two
                    different principles are applied. First; After the removal of the bladder and lymph nodes with the
                    robot, the procedure of the new bladder creation from the intestines is performed via an open method
                    and the operation is completed. However, a large incision is required for this surgical technique
                    and since the intestines are taken out of the body, problems such as infection, drying, fluid and
                    heat loss may occur. Bladder cancer operations in the Memorial Şişli Hospital Robotic Surgery Center
                    are performed in a completely closed manner which is a technique used only by very few centers and
                    surgeons around the globe. The operation consists of removal of the bladder, removal of the lymph

                    patients are unaware of this. During extraction of the prostate, the sexual function providing
                    nerves and urine retention mechanism are better preserved thanks to the magnification, close-up

                Robotic Surgery Center
                About the Department
                Da Vinci Robotic Surgery or also known as robotics, is the most advanced technology in the medical world
                and is especially used in Turkey, especially in major centers in the US, including the departments of
                urology, gynecology, general surgery, otorhinolaryngology, thoracic surgery and cardiovascular surgery.
                The “da Vinci Robot Technology” stands out as a technology with special privileges it provides to the
                physician and the patient and is today one of the most successful surgical methods used in the fight
                against cancer all over the world. The robot assisted laparoscopic surgery method, shortly known as
                “robotic surgery” has three main characteristics. The first of these are the imaging systems, which work

                can rotate 540 degrees so that they can move much more than hand movements. In addition, the natural
                shivering in the hands of a human is not conveyed to the tips of the surgical devices in robotic
                surgery. In this way, the margin of error is also minimized.
                NERVE PROTECTION IN PROSTATE CANCER SURGERIES
                Following prostate cancer surgery, which is the most common male cancer occurring especially in men over
                50 years of age and developed in countries other than skin cancer, sexual dysfunction and urinary
                incontinence problems, which are the two most important risks negatively affecting the social life of
                men, can be observed. These risks, which can negatively affect the patient's quality of life, are
                minimized in prostate cancer surgeries performed via the “da Vinci Robotic Surgery” technique. The
                erectile nerves and the urinary retention muscles adjacent to the prostate and leading to the penis are
                much better protected via robot technology. Thanks to this qualified protection, the risks of urinary
                incontinence and the risk of penile erectile dysfunction are minimized. With the “Intrafacial Nerve
                Protection” technique applied via robot surgery, the risk of experiencing sexual activity problem after
                a surgery is minimized.
                The privileges which the da Vinci also provides to the patient in prostate surgery:
                <li class="justify">The length of hospital stay after the da Vinci Robotic surgery is 1 or 2 days.
                    Approximately 95% of the patients have been discharged home on the second postoperative day.

                <li class="justify">Approximately 90% of patients return to their routine work with or after 3 weeks of
                    operation with da Vinci Robotic Surgery.
                    KIDNEY PROTECTIVE EFFECT IN KIDNEY TUMOR OPERATIONS
                    In kidney tumor surgeries performed via the da Vinci technique, cancer control is provided in the
                    best possible way. Only the tumor tissue is removed and the healthy kidney is left in the patient.
                    Under the three-dimensional and high-resolution enlarged image with robot technology, the tumor is
                    easily removed from the kidney by performing depth calculation in the tissue. The area where the
                    tumor emerges can be sutured quickly and with depth control. After the removal of the tumor tissue,
                    the resulting tissue cavity, opened veins and injured urinary channels are repaired extensively and
                    rapidly by using robotic arms. This method can be performed for the removal of the kidney in
                    large-scale kidney cancer.

                    because in one-third of patients with bladder cancer, prostate cancer may develop as well while the
                    patients are unaware of this. During extraction of the prostate, the sexual function providing
                    nerves and urine retention mechanism are better preserved thanks to the magnification, close-up

                    and if everything goes well, they are discharged in less than a week. At the end of 3 weeks with a
                    catheter, the complete healing of the sutures of the urinary bladder formed from intestines is
                    checked, if healing is complete, the catheter is removed.

                    </h4>
                    <p class="justify">In addition to urology and general surgery, da Vinci Robotic Surgery is the most
                        common surgical treatment of gynecological diseases. According to 2013 data, the number of
                        surgeries performed with robots in female diseases is higher than urology surgeries. Robot
                        technology has brought a new dimension to long-term laparoscopic gynecology surgeries, thanks to
                        the surgeon's ability to perform a surgery on the console while sitting down.</p>
                    <h5 class="color-memorial text-bold mb-20 mt-40">Outstanding technology success in cancer surgery
                    </h5>
                    <p class="justify">Gynecological, uro-gynecologic and oncologic surgeries are among the most
                        difficult surgeries. Robotic surgery is used as the most advanced technology in all gynecologic
                        cancers except advanced stage ovarian cancers. It can be used in all stages of the “endometrium”
                        cancer, also known as uterine cancer and cervix cancers within surgical margins. Robotic surgery
                        is also used for myomectomy surgeries performed due to infertility and uterine sagging. When the
                        uterine myoma are removed and closed via the laparoscopic method, the risk rupture of the
                        healing area during the next pregnancy may increase due to the failure of the suture. However,
                        the risk of stitching is minimal in robotic surgery thanks to its superior sutures. In the later
                        stages of endometriosis, it is difficult to clean them with laparoscopic surgery because the
                        surrounding tissues are very adherent. Robotic surgery is preferred because movements are
                        performed more easily via robots in such surgeries.</p>
                    <h5 class="color-memorial text-bold mb-20 mt-40">Technological superiority</h5>
                    <p class="justify">Robotic surgery offers many advantages for both the patient and the surgeon
                        thanks to the technological developments and ease of use. The patient stay and recovery time is
                        much shorter than open surgery. Moreover, there are no surgical traces since only some small
                        incisions are made. Robotic surgery provides easy access to the pelvic system. The mobility of
                        the devices used is also very high. The surgical procedure is carried out in an advanced,
                        comfortable and fast way. The surgery is performed more safely because hand vibrations are not
                        conveyed to the robotic arms. Less risk of bleeding is present. The recovery time of the patient
                        is shortened. The risk of infection is lower. The three-dimensional imaging advantage
                        facilitates the surgeon's work. Since the surgeon works by sitting on a console during the
                        surgery, it is less effortful and does not affect the surgeons concentration.</p>

                        the location of the organ that makes pancreatic cancer more important than other types of
                        cancer. The pancreas, which plays a very important role in the body, is difficult to intervene
                        surgically. Therefore, the term “untouchable” is usually used for the pancreas. </p>
                    <h5 class="color-memorial text-bold mb-20 mt-40"> Pancreatic Cancer Treatment Process</h5>
                    <p class="justify">If the patient is diagnosed with pancreatic cancer via MRI or tomography, a
                        biopsy should be performed to determine if the diagnosis is definite. If a mass is detected and
                        the patient has complaints such as jaundice and weight loss, the diagnosis is probably correct.
                        Endoscopic biopsy may be necessary in suspected cases. The most important stage of treatment is
                        surgery. Whether the patient's tumor will be surgically removed is determined by staging. If no
                        metastasis is present in the liver or other organs and the involvement of large vessels is not
                        severe, the patient is operated first. Additional treatments are planned according to the
                        patient's condition after the surgery. In patients with no chance of surgery, chemotherapy is
                        administered first. In the case of regression of the tumor with drug treatments, it is
                        reassessed whether the patient can be a candidate for surgery. In case of metastasis of
                        pancreatic cancer to many foci and distant organs in the body, first of all, chemotherapy and
                        then alternative treatment options are discussed. The most important point that should not be
                        considered in pancreatic cancer is that the behavior of the tumor varies from person to person
                        as is the case in every cancer type. Therefore, each patient has a chance of treatment and these
                        options should be investigated. </p>

                <p class="justify">The use of robotic surgery in ear, nose, throat and head-neck surgery provides great
                    advantages for patients. It is used in many ear, nose and throat diseases such as benign tumors and
                    cysts which are located in the larynx, pharynx, tonsils, tongue and mouth. The da Vinci robotic
                    surgery provides a comfortable and safe post operation period for the patients and enables them to
                    return to their normal social life in a short duration. </p>
                <h5 class="color-memorial text-bold mb-20 mt-40">How is robotic surgery used in ear nose throat surgery?
                </h5>
                <p class="justify">Robotic surgery is a technique and technology with a past of 10 years. Surgical
                    treatment of ear nose throat problems has been used around the globe and in our country since 2010.
                </p>
                <p class="justify">The da Vinci surgical system in general surgery and urology departments is used for
                    surgeries such as abdominal surgeries via robot arms that enter the abdomen through holes on the
                    skin of the abdomen. Otorhinolaryngology operations are performed by entering the oral cavity
                    without any hole or incision. Therefore, in defining this surgical method, the term “Trans-oral
                    Robotic Surgery“ which means ”Through the mouth”. </p>
                <p class="justify">The da Vinci and trans-oral robotic surgeries are performed with instruments
                    connected to robotic arms. These surgeries are carried out under three dimensional and 16 times
                    enlarged endoscopic images using precision control systems with very small instruments that have the
                    skill and sensitivity that the human hand cannot achieve. </p>
                <p class="justify">Dependent on the disease on which surgical intervention will be performed, in
                    surgeries performed through the mouth thinner and smaller instruments are utilized than in other
                    robotic surgeries When the human hand is compared to the da Vinci robot; the fact that it eliminates
                    the risk of shaking and has much more movement angles creates the opportunity to perform minimally
                    invasive surgical procedures by protecting the healthy tissues and functions without damaging the
                    vessel - nerve structures. </p>

                <p class="justify">In addition, in the presence of an excessively large tongue (macroglossia), the
                    procedure for manipulating the tongue with robotic surgery can be performed in experienced hands.

                <h5 class="color-memorial text-bold mb-20 mt-40">What are the advantages of robotic surgery to classical
                    open surgery in ear nose throat surgeries?</h5>
                <p class="justify">In classical surgeries of the ear, throat and head-neck, large incisions are made in
                    the neck area, the face and the jaw bone and the procedures are performed. Since these operations
                    are performed by the oral method of Vinci robotic surgery, the surgery is completed without any
                    incision on the skin and the healing process of the patient is much faster. All these procedures
                    lead to less bleeding, less surgical scarring, and less risk of infection in patients. Patients have
                    a short hospital stay and return to their normal nutritional habits and speech abilities much
                    faster. </p>

                    endoscopic surgery?</h5>
                <li class="justify">The robot has more mobility than the 5 mm wrist, and the wrist mimicking tips reach
                    the most remote locations and allow the surgical procedure to be performed.</li>
                <li class="justify">The ends of the robot can move 540 degrees on 7 planes. Endoscopic instruments can
                    move in one plane.</li>
                <li class="justify">The robot eliminates hand shaking. In robotic surgery, the surgeon's hand does not
                    shake. In endoscopic surgery, shaking is a very serious problem.</li>
                <li class="justify">Tools may become curled and bent. Endoscopic instruments are rigid, cannot be bent.
                </li>
                <li class="justify">Sutures can be performed in robotic surgery. While in endoscopic surgery this is not
                    the case.</li>
                <li class="justify">Robotic surgery provides a 3-dimensional view. Endoscopic surgery provides a
                    2-dimensional view.</li>
                <li class="justify">In robotic surgery, the surgical area is magnified 16 times. Magnification is not
                    possible with endoscopes.</li>
                <li class="justify">In endoscopic surgery, the surgeon can only utilize one hand since one hand is
                    occupied holding the endoscope. In robotic surgery, the surgeon can use both hands in the surgical
                    area. In addition, both hands of the surgeon can help with procedures at the surgical site. This
                    enables the possibility of sutures and 4 procedures on the same site. While the surgery durations
                    are shortened, procedures that cannot be performed in endoscopic surgery can be performed via
                    robotic surgery.</li>
                <h5 class="color-memorial text-bold mb-20 mt-40">How is the da Vinci robotic surgery utilized in sleep
                    apnea surgeries?</h5>
                <p class="justify">One of the newest uses of robotic surgery is obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. In
                    obstructive sleep apnea, some levels of the upper respiratory tract become obstructed during sleep.
                    With known methods, surgery is performed on the soft palate, tonsils and small tongue. However,
                    these methods are not sufficient in more than half of the patients. In most of the obstructive sleep
                    apnea patients, obstruction is observed at the tongue base and at the level of the flap above the
                    epiglottis. </p>
                <p class="justify">With previously known methods, the root of the tongue and flap above the larynx could
                    not be approached without an incision. However, robotic surgery can be performed easily without a
                    neck incision in this region. A multi-level surgery is performed in patients with obstructive sleep
                    apnea via robotic surgery and all obstructions can be cleared. Patients who have to use sleep
                    breathing apparatus such as CPAP are provided with the comfort of deviceless sleep. </p>
                <h5 class="color-memorial text-bold mb-20 mt-40">How is robotic surgery utilized in throat cancer
                    surgery</h5>
                <p class="justify">One of the areas where robotic surgery is used is laryngeal cancer. Robotic surgery
                    is advantageously used in early stage patients where the upper part of the throat and the vocal
                    cords are involved. Throat cancer surgery is performed via robotic surgery without opening a hole in
                    the throat, no wound occurs on the neck. </p>
                <p class="justify">The patient recovers in a shorter period of time and starts to talk and regains the
                    ability to swallow much earlier. Robotic surgery can be used safely in early stage tumors of the
                    larynx. </p>

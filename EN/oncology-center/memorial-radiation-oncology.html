                <p class="justify">Radiation is a special kind of energy carried by waves or particles. It can be
                    produced by special devices or released by substances called radioactive material. This energy has
                    been used in medicine for imaging purposes since a long time. Lung x-rays are an example for this.
                    These type of x-rays used for such imaging which can be used at much higher energy levels in order
                    to treat cancer and some other diseases. Special devices are needed to direct the radiation to the
                    diseased organ. The use of high-dose radiation energy for treatment purposes is called
                    "radiotherapy" or "radiation therapy".</p>
                <h4 class="color-memorial text-bold mb-20 mt-40">What Kind of Effect Has Radiotherapy?</h4>
                <p class="justify">High-dose radiation can kill cells or prevent them from dividing and multiplying.
                    Since cancer cells divide and multiply faster than normal cells, radiotherapy is more effective on
                    cancer cells than normal cells. In addition, normal cells recovered much easier and faster than
                    cancer cells. In the so-called planning stage, physicians direct the treatment by drawing necessary
                    drawings to expose the diseased tissues to the maximum and normal tissues to the minimum amount of
                    radiation.</p>
                <h4 class="color-memorial text-bold mb-20 mt-40">What Are the Benefits and Goals of Radiotherapy?</h4>
                <p class="justify">Radiotherapy is used in many cancer types in almost every region of the body.
                    Nearly half of cancer patients are also undergoing radiotherapy. In some types of cancer,
                    radiotherapy is the only treatment.</p>
                <p class="justify">Radiotherapy can be applied alone or in combination with surgery and/or medication
                    therapy ("Chemotherapy") in order to completely cure many patients.</p>
                <p class="justify">Radiotherapy is sometimes performed with the aim of reducing the tumor size prior to
                    surgery. In some tumors, it is performed for the purpose of cleaning the cancer cells that may have
                    remained after surgery. There are also methods of radiotherapy used during surgery. Cancer type are
                    present as well in which radiotherapy and chemotherapy is directly administered without any surgery.
                </p>
                <p class="justify">In some cases where it is not possible to fully cure the disease, radiotherapy may be
                    used to reduce the patient's complaints such as pain and bleeding. This type of treatment is called
                    "palliative treatment".</p>
                <h4 class="color-memorial text-bold mb-20 mt-40">Are Risks Present?</h4>
                <p class="justify">As with many methods of treatment, there are some radiotherapy related risks.
                    Radiation at doses that will destroy cancer cells may damage normal cells and tissues. In this case,
                    the patient may experience side effects. How to deal with side effects is described in the later
                    sections of the booklet booklet. The risk of side effects is generally much lower than the benefits
                    of killing cancer cells.</p>
                <p class="justify">Your physician will recommend that you receive radiotherapy if the benefit expected
                    from treatment is much greater than the possible risks.</p>
                <h3>How is Radiotherapy Administered?</h3>
                <p class="justify">Radiotherapy can be administered in two ways: External (external) and internal
                    (internal). In some patients, these two forms can be administered in many cases.</p>
                <p class="justify">In most patients, radiotherapy is performed externally. It is generally performed in
                    outpatient treatment centers and it is carried out by directing rays to the diseased tissue by using
                    radiotherapy devices. External treatments were carried out in recent years with devices called
                    cobalt-60 or linear accelerators. In two-dimensional treatments, normal tissue damage and side
                    effects were more common because large margins of safety used to provide the target with a
                    sufficient dose of radiation. However, in recent years, with the dramatic changes in radiotherapy
                    devices, three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy, IMRT (intensity-adjusted radiotherapy),
                    sterotactic radiotherapy (linak-based, gammaknife, cyberknife) are administereed and the maximum
                    dose is applied to the target volume while normal tissue only receives a minimal amount of
                    radiation. Your physician will also decide which device is best for you when you are being
                    administered radiation therapy.</p>
                <p class="justify">In the internal radiation therapy treatment, the radioactive material or the source
                    is placed either in a thin wire or in the tubes, either directly into the tumor or in a body cavity.
                    Occasionally, placement can be performed in the remaining space after a surgery.</p>
                <h4 class="color-memorial text-bold mb-20 mt-40">Who Administers Radiotherapy?</h4>
                <p class="justify">The â€œRadiation oncologist", a physician who specializes in the treatment of diseases
                    with radiation, determines the type of treatment you need and carries out the planning. This
                    physician will be called "your doctor" throughout the booklet.</p>
                <p class="justify">During your treatment, radiation oncologists work with a special team. The following
                    professionals are present in this team:</p>
                <li class="justify">Radiation physicist: Checks devices are working properly and delivering appropriate
                    doses of radiation</li>
                <li class="justify">Dosimetrist: Determines the number and duration of sessions in treatments</li>
                <li class="justify">Radiotherapy nurse: Provides nursing services during treatment and helps you to deal
                    with side effects.</li>
                <li class="justify">Radiotherapy technician: Performs your pre-treatment preparations ensures the
                    operation of the treatment devices.</li>
                <li class="justify">Apart from this team, you may also get help from a dietitian, physiotherapist,
                    social service worker and other health professionals.</li>
                <h4 class="color-memorial text-bold mb-20 mt-40">External Radiotherapy: What to Expect? How Does Your
                    Doctor Prepare a Treatment Plan?</h4>
                <p class="justify">Radiation sources used in radiotherapy are various. Your doctor may use an X-ray or
                    electron beam. The choice of source of radiation to be used is determined by the type of tumor, its
                    location in the body and in particular, its depth. High energy X-rays are used for treatment of many
                    types of cancer. Electron bundles can treat some skin diseases.</p>
                <p class="justify">Before starting the treatment, a preparatory session is performed with computerized
                    tomography. The aim is to personalize the treatment and determine the irradiation technique which
                    should be chosen according to the type and prevalence of your cancer. The details of this
                    preparatory session and the treatment itself (especially the frequency and duration of sessions)
                    will be reported to you by your radiation oncologist during the initial examination. Firstly, during
                    the radiotherapy sessions, the position that you have to take in the device is determined, then the
                    computerized tomography is obtained in this position. Performing a treatment plan with computed
                    tomography allows detection of the most risky areas related to tumor and/or tumor spread, as well as
                    the detection of normal tissues that need to be protected. During tomography, an intravenous
                    injection, or sometimes a urinary catheter on the area to be imaged may be required, depending on
                    the area to be displayed. The radiation therapist marks your skin from one radiotherapy session to
                    the other in order to ensure that the target volume is irradiated under the same conditions. For
                    this purpose, ink pens that do vanish easily can be used or temporary tattoos may be applied.
                    However, it is necessary to take care not to wash out these marks when showering, because these
                    signs will be needed until your treatment is finished. In case of vanishing, you must inform your
                    therapist. Please do not try to complete the vanished marks yourself.</p>
                <p class="justify">After the target volume and normal tissue are determined by your doctor via
                    tomography sections, your doctor will discuss with the dosimetrist and radiation physicist how much
                    radiation dose you need and how many sessions will be administered. This usually takes a few days.
                </p>
                <p class="justify">Once your treatment has begun, your doctor will monitor your response to treatment,
                    your general condition and possible side effects. This is usually performed once a week, but the
                    frequency may vary depending on your needs. It is important that you receive scheduled treatments on
                    time. Disruptions in the plan may reduce the expected efficacy of treatment.</p>
                <h4 class="color-memorial text-bold mb-20 mt-40">What Happens During the Treatment Session?</h4>
                <p class="justify">You may need to take off your clothes and wear an apron before the treatment begins.
                    Therefore, it is useful to use clothes you can easily change.</p>
                <p class="justify">In the treatment room, the radiotherapy technician uses the previously marked lines
                    on your skin to determine the treatment area. You need to sit in a special chair or lie down on the
                    treatment table. Although each treatment session lasts 15 to 30 minutes in the treatment room, the
                    administration of the radiation dose takes place in a period of 1 to 5 minutes. External
                    radiotherapy is painless as it is in an X-ray procedure.</p>
                <p class="justify">You don't need to hold your breath, you just need to breathe normally. It is
                    important to ensure that the dose defined in the radiotherapy sessions is administered in the most
                    sensitive way and the rays reach the correct place in the body, the position of the patient is not
                    distorted throughout the treatment, the same position is used in each treatment and the environment
                    provides the best possible comfort to the patient. In this process, which we call immobilization,
                    accessories such as head-neck masks, vacuum beds, knee fixators or shoulder pullers can be used.</p>
                <p class="justify">The radiotherapy technician leaves the room before the beam is emitted. The devices
                    are controlled from a small area nearby. You are being watched via a monitor or window. During this
                    time, even if you are alone, your voice can be heard from the speaker and the technician can contact
                    you when you speak. Radiotherapy devices are quite large and can produce noise when rotating around
                    the treatment area at different angles. Initially, the size and noise of the devices may sound
                    frightening. It should be noted that the devices are operated by professional technicians and their
                    proper operation is continuously checked. Ask the technician or your doctor about any questions you
                    might have about your treatment room or devices.</p>
                <p class="justify">You cannot see, hear or feel the radiation in any way. If you feel very uncomfortable
                    during the treatment session, inform the technician immediately. The operation of the devices can be
                    stopped immediately if necessary.</p>
                <h4 class="color-memorial text-bold mb-20 mt-40">What Does Hyperfractional Treatment Mean?</h4>
                <p class="justify">Radiotherapy is administered by dividing the treatment into daily doses according to
                    tumor type and location. In hyperfractional radiotherapy, the daily dose is divided into several
                    small parts. If an area is to be divided into several treatments a day, the treatment is usually
                    performed in 4-6 hour intervals.</p>
                <h4 class="color-memorial text-bold mb-20 mt-40">What is Intraoperative Radiotherapy?</h4>
                <p class="justify">Intraoperative radiotherapy is simultaneously applied during surgery. The surgeon
                    removes the tumor tissue as much as possible and radiotherapy is administered to the tumor bed
                    immediately after surgery to clear the tumor cells that may have remained in the area.</p>
                <h4 class="color-memorial text-bold mb-20 mt-40">What Are the Effects of Treatment?</h4>
                <p class="justify">External radiotherapy does not make your body radioactive. For this reason, there is
                    no need to avoid contact with other people because of this treatment. Even in contact situations
                    such as hugging, kissing, there is no risk of negatively affecting other people.</p>
                <p class="justify">The side effects of radiotherapy are generally related to the treated area. Your
                    doctor and nurse will inform you about these side effects and how to deal with them. If you have
                    symptoms such as coughing, fever, sweating or unusual pain during treatment, inform your doctor or
                    nurse. Although most of the side effects are uncomfortable, they can be controlled via medication or
                    diet. These usually disappear within a few weeks after the end of treatment. However, some side
                    effects may last longer. Most patients do not experience any side effects. More detailed information
                    is available in the "coping with side effects" section of this booklet.</p>
                <p class="justify">The effectiveness of your treatment will be monitored by your doctor. After your
                    treatment, you may notice pain, bleeding, and other similar complaints. Over time, you will also
                    feel other signs of improvement. Your doctor will probably request some tests while monitoring the
                    treatment effects. Examples for this are routine blood tests with which white counts of blood cells
                    and platelets (clotting-related cells) are monitored. It is common for these numbers to be low
                    during treatment.</p>

                </h4>
                <p class="justify">Memorial Health Group which provided the Turkish Health Sector with Sense of Quality
                    blazed a new trial.</p>
                <p class="justify">Memorial which obtained the JCI Accreditation Certificate, which establishes the

                    management of Prof. Dr. Emel Demiralp.</p>
                <p class="justify">With the EFI Accreditation which is an institution composed by the tissue typing
                    laboratories in Europe within years and which covers more than 200 laboratories at the present
                    moment, the results obtained from Memorial Immunology laboratory will be accepted all around the
                    world.</p>
                <p class="justify">Prof. Dr. Zeynep Emel Demiralp who is the Responsible Person of the Tissue Typing and

                    Certificate which has the characteristic of the certificate demonstrating that Memorial is
                    considered equivalent with the Immunogenetic Laboratories of the European countries on "Tissue
                    Typing and Transplantation Immunology".</p>
                <h4 class="color-memorial text-bold mb-20 mt-40">We are one of the limited laboratories of Europe</h4>
                <p class="justify">We are the most essential part of the organ transplantation center as Memorial Tissue
                    Typing and Immunology Laboratory. The results obtained from our laboratory allow our organ
                    transplantation team to succeed at world's standards. The importance of the tests performed in the
                    organ transplantation is enormous because we help people to revive by organ transplantation while
                    they are between life and death. Memorial Immunology Laboratory is among the limited centers of
                    Europe in the tests related to organ transplantation.</p>
                <p class="justify"></p>
                <h4 class="color-memorial text-bold mb-20 mt-40">Our test results will be accepted at international
                    level </h4>
                <p class="justify">The test results obtained from the Immunology Laboratory of Memorial Hospital will be
                    the results which the centers and doctors in abroad will accept. There occur sample exchanges
                    between the laboratories having EFI Accreditation. As we will bear the EFI Accreditation number on
                    all of our reports, our results will be valid at all centers of the world.</p>
                <h4 class="color-memorial text-bold mb-20 mt-40">Also the perspective of Europe will change</h4>
                <p class="justify">Memorial Organ Transplantation Center is composed of a team working in coordination
                    with the other branches at our hospital and having achieved the success of the limited centers of
                    the world. That our Tissue Typing and Immunology Laboratory has such a certificate will increase
                    also their trust in us. Furthermore, being at this point in the medical world is also a circumstance
                    that makes us proud. The European countries will evaluate the test results that we send in a
                    reliable manner and we will be accepted in the entire world. We are certifying that very important
                    deeds are being performed also in the sense of laboratory in Turkey.</p>
                <h4 class="color-memorial text-bold mb-20 mt-40">It is necessary to have almost 100 criteria </h4>
                <p class="justify">For the EFI Accreditation Certificate, almost 100 criteria are required and you are
                    required to have such criteria. Everything from the participation in the meetings and congresses
                    related to tissue typing to the training of the employees, from the international notifications
                    required to be published to the in-service meetings are interrogated. It is necessary to have
                    entered into the quality control programs at least 1 year before applying for the accreditation
                    certificate. The data related to all test results is collected and forwarded to the commissioners.
                    Afterwards, when they decide to visit the laboratory, the process begins. According to their
                    reports, you are entitled to obtain certificate.</p>
                <h4 class="color-memorial text-bold mb-20 mt-40">This certificate is an indicator of the achievement
                </h4>
                <p class="justify">We already provide service above a specific quality. We will carry on our studies
                    with the same quality as well. The EFI Accreditation Certificate has become an indicator of these
                    achievements. We aim to increase the achievements of our organ transplantation team all around the
                    world by carrying out much better studies and projects within the next process.</p>
                <h4 class="color-memorial text-bold mb-20 mt-40">Only the university hospitals can obtain in the world
                </h4>
                <p class="justify">As Memorial, we have broken a new ground among the private hospitals. It is not a
                    very accustomed situation to obtain such a certificate for the private hospitals in Europe. We, as a
                    team having academic achievements as well, have gained a great prestige. This application that we
                    made and the certificate that we obtained as a private hospital considerably fascinated the
                    commissioners.</p>
                <h4 class="color-memorial text-bold mb-20 mt-40">It will provide contribution to the health tourism
                </h4>
                <p class="justify">Our tissue typing laboratory is accredited from an international institution. Our
                    Organ Transplantation team is already very valuable. However, our laboratory has EFI accreditation
                    as well. Therefore, you can say to the patients "come to Memorial without thinking". Formerly, when
                    the Turkish patients had the tests performed and went to abroad, the tests used to be had performed
                    again. As our results are acceptable all around the world, it is not necessary to repeat the tests.
                    This is an indicator of the success of having been recognized internationally.</p>

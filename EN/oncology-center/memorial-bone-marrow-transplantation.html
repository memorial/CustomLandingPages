                <p class="justify">Memorial Healthcare Group which has an international reputation in Organ
                    Transplantation offers service via Memorial Bone Marrow Transplantation Center in accordance with
                    its vision of being a reference center in many branches in Turkey. The unit which aims to meet the
                    needs for bone marrow transplantation of the patients who come from many other countries along with
                    Istanbul and Turkey has all the facilities deriving from today’s technology.</p>
                <p class="justify">Having 3 different Bone Marrow Transplantation centers in 3 different cities in
                    Turkey gives the patients an advantage of choice and timeline flexibility.</p>
                <p class="justify">Besides providing the international standards on bone marrow transplantation, the
                    center offers all the services needed by the patients. Those who have blood disorders such as
                    multiple myeloma (malignant bone marrow disease caused by plasma cells), lymphoma (hematological
                    lymph node cancer), acute leukemia (cancer of the blood) and chronic leukemia, aplastic anemia can
                    have bone marrow transplant in the center where the treatment processes are conducted within a
                    multidisciplinary structure.</p>
                <h4 class="color-memorial text-bold mb-20 mt-40">Bone Marrow Transplant / Stem Cell Transplant</h4>
                <p class="justify">Stem cells are the cells which are responsible for producing blood in the human
                    organism. The transplant of these cells which have profoundly special functions are generally called
                    “bone marrow transplant” or “stem cell transplant”. Bone marrow transplant is called “autologous
                    transplant” when it is performed in the patient by their own stem cells and is called “allogenic
                    transplant” when it is performed by the cells taken from relatives or from unrelated donors who have
                    tissue compatibility. The stem cell of the blood is transplanted in the bone marrow transplant.</p>
                <p class="justify">In the past, stem cells used to be directly collected from bone marrow via special
                    needles under operating room conditions. However, this method is rarely applied today. In the recent
                    years, the stem cells are transferred from the bone marrow to the blood via a special medication and
                    the cells are collected by a method called “apheresis”. This method requires no surgical
                    intervention. Transplant of the bone marrow requires no surgical procedure, either. The marrow is
                    transplanted in the patient via vascular access, the bone marrow cells find the bone marrow
                    themselves via their biological features and start the blood production. The main challenge of the
                    marrow transplant is to follow up the patient while the marrow acquires function in its new
                    location. In this critical period, red and white blood cells and thrombocytes which are responsible
                    for coagulation cannot be produced. Therefore, this is a period in which complications such as
                    anemia, infection and hemorrhage may develop. It is crucial to prevent the marrow rejection or the
                    diseases caused by the new marrow via the treatment of the undesirable situations such as infections
                    and hemorrhage which may develop in this period.</p>
                <p class="justify">The success in bone marrow transplant is achieved when a good technical
                    infrastructure and good isolation from microbes, an interdisciplinary accord, cooperation and team
                    experience collaborate and when the departments such as intensive care provide the necessary
                    intervention in the organ transplant and in the accompanying complications.</p>

                <h4 class="color-memorial text-bold mb-20 mt-40">About the Department</h4>
                <p class="justify">Approximately 5-10% of cancer is inherited. Individuals with a genetic predisposition
                    will have a far higher chance of developing cancer within their lifetime and at an earlier age.
                    Genetic testing can help determine whether a family has a hereditary cancer predisposition syndrome.
                    Individuals who have genetically higher risks to develop certain cancers are recommended to follow
                    high-risk cancer surveillance and management. The Genetic Cancer Clinic Program can coordinate
                    genetic testing and high-risk cancer surveillance for individuals and their families with hereditary
                    cancer syndromes.</p>
                <br />
                <h4 class="color-memorial text-bold mb-20 mt-40">Genetic Testing</h4>
                <p class="justify">If you think you might be at risk for an inherited cancer, it's a good idea to meet
                    with a genetics counselor. He or she will review your family medical history, talk to you about the
                    role of genetics in cancer and perform a hereditary cancer risk assessment. This assessment will
                    cover:</p>
                <li class="justify">Your chances of having a genetic mutation</li>
                <li class="justify">Personalized genetic testing recommendations</li>
                <li class="justify">A general estimate of your personal cancer risks</li>
                <li class="justify">Individualized cancer screening and prevention recommendations</li>
                <h4 class="color-memorial text-bold mb-20 mt-40">How is Genetic Testing Done?</h4>
                <p class="justify">Based on your cancer risk assessment, the genetic counselor may recommend that you
                    undergo genetic testing. This simply involves having a blood sample drawn. The results may help
                    determine whether members of your family face higher risks for certain types of cancer.</p><br>
                <p class="justify">Keep in mind that genetic testing isn't for everyone. It involves many ethical, legal
                    and social issues that require careful consideration. By having a genetic counselor evaluate your
                    family history, you can make a more informed decision about whether genetic testing may be
                    appropriate for you or your family.</p>

                <h4 class="color-memorial text-bold mb-20 mt-40">Should I consider having cancer genetic counseling?
                </h4>
                <p class="justify">You should consider seeing a genetic counselor for a cancer risk assessment if your
                    personal and/or family history has features of hereditary cancer. Hereditary cancers tend to differ
                    from non-hereditary cancers in the following ways :</p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="justify">The age cancer is diagnosed is usually younger than in the general population
                        (often younger than age 50).</li>
                    <li class="justify">Multiple people from the same side of the family tend to have the same or
                        related types of cancer.</li>
                    <li class="justify">Cancer is more likely to develop in more than one site in the body.</li>
                    <p class="justify">Additionally, people with the following should consider genetic counseling :</p>
                    <li class="justify">Breast or ovarian cancer diagnosis with Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry (Eastern or
                        Central European Jews)</li>
                    <li class="justify">Polyposis (multiple polyps in the colon, stomach, or small intestine)</li>
                    <li class="justify">Certain rare cancers, such as male breast cancer, retinoblastoma, medullary
                        thyroid cancer, or pheochromocytoma / paraganglioma</li>
                    <li class="justify">A family member with a genetic test diagnosing a hereditary cancer syndrome</li>
                </ul>
                <h4 class="color-memorial text-bold mb-20 mt-40">How do I make a genetic counseling appointment at
                    Memorial Genetic Cancer Clinic?</h4>
                <p class="justify">You can either refer yourself or ask their doctor for a referral to genetic
                    counseling. New patients interested in having a cancer risk assessment should contact the Clinical
                    Cancer Genetic Cancer Clinical Program at <a href="tel://+90 549 639 3366">+90 549 639 33 66</a></p>

                <p class="justify">Cancer has been the second most important but also life-threatening health problems
                    in the world as well as in Turkey after the cardio-vascular diseases, and unfortunately the
                    incidence is gradually increasing due to various reasons. Although there is a significant difference
                    when considering each type of cancer, an individual's risk of developing a type of cancer is
                    increasing day by day.</p>
                <p class="justify">Cancer, thanks to the strategies developed in terms of diagnosis and treatment, is
                    today among the manageable diseases. In particular, some types of cancer can ultimately be cured by
                    eliminating risk factors, raising social awareness and early screening.</p>
                <p class="justify">Today, the current achievement when considering the treatment of cancer, is the
                    development of individual treatment strategies. Thanks to these methods determined according to the
                    characteristics of the tumor, we can enhance the life quality of the patients. Nowadays, in addition
                    to basic therapies against cancer such as surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, a rather
                    multidisciplinary approach is considered such as smart drugs targeted at the tumor cell together
                    with standard chemotherapies, radiotherapy methods whose side effects are minimized, significant
                    surgical methods, interventional radiology and special applications in the field of nuclear
                    medicine. At the Memorial Chemotherapy Centers, a multidisciplinary approach including individual
                    treatment programs, scientific approaches and technological infrastructure used by the specialist
                    doctors, is preferred along with the classical therapies.</p>
                <p class="justify"><span style="color:red">Chemotherapy</span> which is considered as the golden
                    standard of many types of cancers is still among the most important treatments of the disease. The
                    chemotherapy applications shooting for to prevent the growth and spread of cancer cells are now
                    planned specifically for patients and tumor cells. Smart drugs and antibody treatments targeting
                    only defected tissues are successfully applied at Memorial Chemotherapy Centers, where scientific
                    and current treatments are always concurrently utilized with the rest of the world.</p>
                <p class="justify">The right choice of the drugs during chemotherapy is very important when considering
                    both the success of the treatment and the minimization of patients' exposure to the side effects.
                    Drug treatment in Memorial Chemotherapy Centers is programmed by successful medical onchology
                    professionals with international experience, considering the type of tumor, age, general condition
                    and other disease factors.</p>
